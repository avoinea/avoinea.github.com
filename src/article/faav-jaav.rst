============================
What FAAV (JAAV) stands for?
============================
**FAAV**  (JAAV) is a replacement for **RTFM** when there is no manual or any
obvious instruction about the asked question.

This came to me this morning when one of my collegues approched me on
messenger telling me that: HE MAY FOUND A BUG while using my precious and
unbreakable product called EEA Faceted Navigation.

Even if EEA Faceted Navigation is synonim with "The perfect software add-on
that never had and never will have bugs" and despite the fact that I closed
tens of tickets with status "Won't fix. This is not a bug, it's a feature" I
decided to take a look and see what's going on. After spending half an hour on
it, the inevitable happened: "It was not a bug, it was a normal behaviour".

At this point, I was about to say RTFM. But, as there is no fuckin' manual,
yet (neither do I belive this ``yet`` anymore) this acronym came out:

- **FAAV** - Fuckin' Ask Alin Voinea

or, if you want to be polite:

- **JAAV** - Just Ask Alin Voinea

Now you know and more important if you find a bug while using EEA Faceted
Navigation remember that:

.. NOTE::
   It may not be a bug, It may be a feature
